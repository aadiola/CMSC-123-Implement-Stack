# CMSC-123-Implement-Stack

This machine problem solution presents an implementation of the data structure **stack**.

## About the Machine Problem

The machine problem solved here is how to implement a stack using a linked list. This solution also provide visual utility functions for easier visualization of the stack.


## About CMSC 123

CMSC 123, or better known as __Data Structures__, is a theory and programming course offered for Computer Science students in the [University of the Philippines Cebu](upcebu.edu.ph) during their sophomore year. This course primarily deals with  data structures (DS) and their underlying implementations and is encompassed by the following topics:

- Algorithmic Analysis
- Containers
- Memory Allocations
- List (Arrays)
- Linked List
- List/Linked-list -based DS (e.g. stack, queue, trees, graphs)
- Hash Tables
- Sorting
